<h1 style="font-size:28px">Audi A6</h1>
<h2 style="font-size:28px">Brand New Inside and Out<br></h2>
<p style="font-size:22px"></center>
Starting from a new design direction first seen in the Audi Prologue concept car, the Audi A6 cuts a sharper profile with acute angles, defined edges and taut, muscular contours. Its lines take the eyes on a journey, while expressive surface language shapes its character.

<p style="font-size:22px">With no diesel engine in its armour, the Audi A6 is limited to a BS6 2.0-litre petrol motor; the 45TFSI. In this avatar, it cooks up a fiery 241bhp/370Nm that makes it competitive in the face of its segment rivals. All that power is laid down on the road through the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. For starters, it doesn’t take that much time behind the wheel for one to appreciate the motor’s impressive refinement; it’s barely audible. Even when you floor the accelerator to make quick progress there’s barely any buzz. What also comes to light while you’re at it are the smooth gearshifts, and although one wouldn’t deem it as one of the quickest shifters, it surely doesn’t leave one wanting for more.

<h3 style="font-size:28px">Mercedes Benz S Class</h3>
<h4 style="font-size:28px">The All-New S Class</h4>
<p style="font-size:22px">
The new S-Class focuses on what matters: unique comfort and safety technologies on which you can rely. Whether you are the driver or a passenger in the rear. The trendsetting MBUX operating concept combined with luxurious materials delivers an unprecedented driving experience.

<p style="font-size:22px">The S-Class is the default choice of luxury limousine for India's mega rich. Mercedes has sold over 8,000 S-Classes in India since the fourth-gen model's launch here in 2000 and is looking to add to the tally with this latest, seventh-gen W223 model.
Like every new S-Class, the latest model is built to be “the best car in the world” and represents Mercedes at its forward-looking best. There's more tech than ever before, even if at its core this remains a car primarily built to transport its high net worth occupants in ultimate luxury.
</p>
<p style="font-size:22px"> As before, India gets the long-wheelbase version of the S-Class. The latest model is even longer and wider than the last-gen one (if only marginally so), and at 5.3m long and nearly 2m wide, it's a big, big car. In look, it's every bit as regal as you'd expect an S to be and commands respect like few other sedans can. It's got gravitas, so to speak. Adding in a tinge of sportiness to the look is the AMG Line styling pack that is standard on the first lot of cars for India. The stylised bumpers and larger 20-inch rims do help the S appear quite athletic
